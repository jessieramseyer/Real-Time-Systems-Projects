This is the MTE241 Lab5 starter project. It contains SIM And RAM targets.

You need to complete two files and they are README_Target.csv and general.c.

If your project works on simulator, put Y under the SIM column in READEME_Target.csv file. Otherwise put N under SIM column.
If your project works on the actual hardware, put Y under the RAM column in README_Target.csv file.csv. Otherwise put N under RAM column.
You should put your solution in the general.c file. 

The following files should not be modified.
* final.c
* general.h

The rest of files usually do not require modification though if you wish you are allowed to modify them with caution. 
If your code size is too big to compile and you have attempted all other opssible method to reduce the code size, 
then you may modify the following two files as the last resort.

* RTX_Config.h
* startup_LPC17xx.s
